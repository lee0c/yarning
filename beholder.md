# Beholder

I stuck to the standard beholder design. However, you can make tweaks if you want! I found [this cool tutorial](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/cyclopedia/vgtm/beholders) for rolling to choose visual specifications of your beholder, if you want something random. I'll try to add comments on what you would tweak for those throughout, but I've only made the [standard myself](https://dnd.wizards.com/dungeons-and-dragons/what-is-dnd/monsters/monsters-beholder) - needle teeth, round iris, all eye stalks medium size/length/bulb, etc.

## Materials

### Yarns

Body: I used something made and dyed locally that I found at [Serial Knitters](https://serialknitters.com/) in Kirkland, WA. I think you can use any rather thing, and ideally soft, yarn. As long as you use a crochet hook small enough with it.

Accents: I bought [this collection of mini skeins](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IDI35HA). Everything that isn't the body that I refer to, will be from one of these mini skeins.

### Crochet hook

I used the same size for everything - a 3.5mm hook. You'll be fine as long as the hook size is at least a step smaller than what the yarn calls for. This is amigurumi afterall :)

### Tapestry needle

I like plastic ones because I can bend them and use them like hooks :)

### Insides

- Pipe cleaners: 1 per eye stalk
- Stuffing: like, 5 handfulls. I bought way too much on Amazon.

## Body

The body is really just a 30-line amigurumi sphere, with a mouth slit! What you're doing here is starting with a circle, then increasing/decreasing by 1 per original stitch every row. I like to think of it as a static amount of "sets" of stitches (in this case, 6 sets), each set growing in size by 1 per row. Since I like to cast on 6 in my magic circles, I increased/decreased every row by 6. Some people do 7.

As for the amount of rows, I have 30 crochet rows and 2 casting on and off. You can scale this up or down, as long as you keep the ratio for crochet rows. That's, 1:1:1 for inc:straight:dec. Here, I have 10:10:10, but you could tweak as you see fit.

This is the pattern I used to learn how to make a sphere for the first time.

> Note: I like to merge/split my stitches at the beginning of each set. It works better with the way I count in my head, but some people merge/split at the end. Just make a decision at the beginning, and stick to it for the whole sphere and you'll be fine.

> Note, if you want to give space for a huge mouth that opens wide when standing still, you can replace the hdc stitches in rows 11 and 12 with dc stitches.

## Main Eye

When I made this project, I did the mouth first. That means I added the main eye without access to one side of the "fabric" I had just made for the body! That made sewing a bit of a guessing game. So let's do the main eye first.

### Making the eye

I worked the main eye in single crochets. If you're scaling up huge, you may want to use hdc or dc.

Start with black yarn to represent the middle of the circular eye (maybe I'll go back and look up the word for this later).

> Note: pick which side you want to be the back and the front of the eye. Every time you change color, keep the knot on the back of the eye.

| R5 | sc 2 in first stitch<br/>sc 1 in next 4 stitches<br/>Repeat 5 more times. | 36 |
| R31 | Fasten off | 0 |

### Attaching the eye

Sew it onto the body, centered above the mouth

To find the dead center, look for the creases from where you increased. The increases should form a line, as they're each directly made from an original stitch. There should be a crease centered in reference for the mouth, so center that crease with the eye.

I recommend sewing around the outer row, with white thread.

### Eyelid

This is another part I got from the beholder I found online! You're basically going to make a chain and sew it on on the crease between the eye and the body.

|Row|Do|Ending Stitch Count|
|-|-|-|
| R0 | ch 36 | 36 |
| R1 | sl st back into first stitch | 36 |
| R0 | fasten off | 36 |

Then place it around the eye crease, and sew it on with a thread as close to your body color as you can find. Mine was multiple shades of purple, blue, and black, but black thread served fine.

## Filling & Mouth

Now that you have a mouth hole and an eye stitched on, let's plug in the mouth! Some people like to back their mouths with plastic or cardboard. I prefer the same texture throughout, with the shaping only being done by the filling. The problem is, on the beholder I made, I made the mouth too shallow to be a mouth. So here I am outlining what I should have done.

### Fill the body

Fill your beholder! Make sure to keep a crease in the innards to make room for the mouth. You should be able to karate chop the mouth hole, cutting through the whole you made in the innards rather than squishing them with your chop.

### Crochet the mouth

You're going to make 2 branches off a single chain, so only crochet one of the 2 diagonal threads from each chain per sc. I recommend black yarn from the Mira set for this, but you do you.

> Note, make a long tail behind the chain, you'll pick it up for the second side. Or if you forget no worries just tie a knot and keep it on the side that will be hidden.

| R3 | Fasten off<br/>repeat R1 and R2 starting with tail from other side of chain. | |

### Add teeth to the mouth

I chose needle style teeth, again because it's on the standard beholder you get when you google it, plus I couldn't find a way to make any other tooth option without looking a bit too derpy.

Take a tapestry needle, and thread some white yarn through it (again, I used the Mira set). Make really loose loops all across the mouth interior you just made, see photo as it's hard to explain. I also like to make smaller loops for what will be the bottom of the mouth, this will yield smaller teeth.

Then, make knots on what will be the inside of the mouth interior, don't cut the yarn at all, as these knots will keep the yarn together.

Finally, pull the loops such that the side with knots is taught, and the sides that will face each other have a nice length. And cut them! See photos...

### Stitch the mouth on

Last chance to make sure the filling is right! Get the firmness you want, the shape you want, and make sure there's room for the mouth. Here you have the mouth, so sit it in there and see if it still gives room for you to stick fingers in.

Try and line up a stitch from the outside of the mouth with a stitch on the body. You have 24 on the outside of each lip on on the body, and 24 on the outside of the mouth interior you made. I chose to stitch them together with black thread, again because black was used in the making of my body color. I suggest using whatever color matches your body, as opposed to prioritizing the mouth interior, because you can always stitch behind the teeth and nobody has to see what color you used if it doesn't match the mouth interior.

## Eye Stalks

### Make the stalks

First, pick bunch of eye colors! Do the following for each stalk

|Row|Do|Ending Stitch Count|
|-|-|-|
| R0 | mc with 7 sc<br/>cut the end of your yarn, tie 2 or 3 knots with the body color as close to the crochet hook as you can get it.<br/>sl st 1 stitch | 7 |
| R1 | hdc 2 in 6 stitches<br/>sk 1 stitch | 12 (looks like 13 since you haven't started the row after the sk yet) |
| R3-4 | hdc 12 | 12 |
| R5 | hdc2tog for all 12 stitches | 6 |
| R6-? | hdc spirals until the stalk is long enough | stop counting! |

> Note, for that last row, if you use the same pipe cleaners I did, I just went until the stalk was as long as a pipe cleaner. Probably 6 inches?

### Attach the stalks

Determine ahead of time where you will attach your eye stalks. I added 1 per crease from the decrease rounts, 1 in the center at the top, and 1 centered between each a bit farther down as well (ignoring the face area). It's up to you. Just sew them on, and use a color that blends with your body color.

## Why cast on 7 for all the eyes

This choice is purely from trial and error, for the color blending. The amount of severed eyes I have in a bag at home is astounding! Because the eye color is only in the cast on, not an actual crocheted row, you have to keep that circle as tight as possible. I found that, via casting on 7 in the desired color, the 7th can be used to help with the color merging - see how in row 2 you use that 7th stitch as the eye-facing part of the last stitch in the first crocheted row? That's what this does. If you can pull it off, it'll still show 6 spikes of the eye color because you stitched 6 and 7 together.
